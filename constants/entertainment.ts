      `Being with a partner has always been a major part of human life. Feeling that you are loved and having a sense of connection is like an ease to our mental health.`,
      `However, it is proven that not every relationship can be healthy; some can create toxicity as well, so it is important to recognize the red flags and avoid toxic patterns.`,
      `And here is your guide to finding red flags in a relationship.`,
      `8.webp`,
      `***1. Lack of Trust`,
      `Trust is the foundation of any relationship. It should be from both sides, people can have doubts sometimes but it should not turn into distrust.`,
      `9.webp`,
      `***2. Gaslighting`,
      `You have probably heard of it, it's a hot topic in today's dating world. When your partner blames you for something you did, it's a clear red flag.`,
      `10.webp`,
      `***3. Controlling or Manipulative Behavior`,
      `It is one of the most common red flags in relationships. If they start controlling your every moment, your relationships with others, or even how you dress and where you go, then it is a red flag.`,
      `11.webp`,
      `***4. Overly Jealous Behaviour`,
      `Being a little jealous in a relationship is okay and pretty common, too. But if it starts turning into possessive and controlling behaviour, then it might turn into emotional abuse in the future.`,
      `12.webp`,
      `***5. Self Centered`,
      `If they only care about their emotions and their preferences, at first they love to bomb you, and suddenly everything you do is a problem to them. And they think they are always on the right side.`,

      `We all know women’s are not easy to read and sometimes it can be difficult to know whether they like you or not. But there are always a few hints that girls give to let you know that they are into you.`,
      `So here are a few signs through which you can get the idea that she’s into you but is hiding it.`,
      `14.webp`,
      `***Everyone around her knows about you`,
      `If a girl likes you, it's obvious that her friend circle knows about you, and you can confirm it whenever you are around and see how her friends react. They may giggle or say something to each other.`,
      `15.webp`,
      `***She remembers things about you`,
      `If you feel like she remembers something important or even dumb about you or your life, then it means she is interested and pays attention to what you say.`,
      `***She is shy around you and avoids eye contact`,
      `16.webp`,
      `Sometimes, when a girl likes you, she tends to be quiet and shy around you, different from her usual self, to make a good impression and she may look at you but avoid eye contact.`,
      `***She initiates the conversation with you`,
      `One of the signs she likes you is that whenever she is talking to you, whether in person or over the phone, she will be engaged. She won’t use one-word texts or just simple emojis. She will ask questions to keep the conversation going.`,
      `17.webp`,
      `***She is comfortable around you and touches you`,
      `Although girls are shy if they are interested in you, it can be different sometimes if they are comfortable around you. You can feel her always leaning towards you while talking, or she won’t pull aside when you two are close.`,
      `So, as we have shared, the possible signs a girl would give if she is interested in you might differ from person to person. And the best way to know it is by having an open and honest conversation.`,

      `20.webp`,
      `***He tells you about his plans`,
      `If, while having a conversation, he tells you about his plans other than his professional goals, then the reason could be that he sees you in his future.`,
      `21.webp`,
      `***He makes plans and wants you around`,
      `If he is truly interested in you, he will make specific plans for you two and always want to be around.`,

      `34.webp`,
      `***Be responsible and chivalrous`,

      `35.webp`,
      `***Be open`,
      `First dates are about getting to know each other; be ready to talk about yourself, your likes, family, friends, or more, but don’t drop everything at once. Try to be understanding of your date's ideas and beliefs without any judgment; through this, you can get an idea of your compatibility with them.`,

      `Dating an older woman can be a different experience than dating a younger woman. In today’s time, we have heard of many cases of marriages or relationships where there was a huge age gap between the couples. Dating older women can be beneficial because they bring maturity and stability and they are confident and clear about what they want.`,
      `Here are a few of the many reasons why guys date older women:`,
      `***They are confident and stable`,
      `Older women are more confident in themselves, and they have the aura of knowing who they are and what they want and not being here to play any sort of game. They don’t give out mixed signals and bring stability to your life.`,
      `39.webp`,
      `***She knows what she wants`,
      `They have seen the world, have been through a lot, and have much more experience than younger women, which has helped to understand their choices and gives assurance to younger men as they don’t have to decode what the other person wants.`,
      `40.webp`,
      `***You get emotional support`,
      `They have faced a lot of problems in their lives and know how to deal with them. Older women usually have a nurturing side to them. They would be there to listen to you and care for you in tough times, making you feel understood and loved.`,
      `41.webp`,
      `***They are mature`,
      `If you are dating an older woman, then it’s a bonus because they are not only emotionally mature but also mentally mature. She will be able to handle all the challenges that will come along the way, and there will be a sense of equality in the relationship.`,
      `42.webp`,
      `***Less drama and more experience`,
      `As they have already been through a lot in their life and are independent, there will be less drama. They will be straightforward about their feelings, or if they want to communicate about something, there won’t be any mind games to play.`,

      `Speed dating has been on the rise for the past few years, and not only millennials but the younger generation is also trying speed dating. People are now getting done with dating apps because of fake profiles, or most people over there are just looking casual. `,
      `Speed dating brings the old way of dating with a new touch. And here we are sharing a few reasons why millennials love speed dating.`,
      `43.webp`,
      `***The old way with a modern touch`,
      `Speed dating combines the old way of dating with a modern touch. It's not like dating apps where you have to wait for weeks to go on a date, which might not happen sometimes. But with speed dating, you meet potential partners directly over a date.`,
      `44.webp`,
      `***Meeting new people`,
      `It's not only trendy because you want to meet a partner or lover; people usually attend these dating events to meet new people, expand their friend circle, or create professional bonds as well.`,
      `45.webp`,
      `***Boosts your confidence`,
      `In speed dating, whether you find a match or not, it helps you to be more comfortable having conversations, and you get to know what needs work, which makes you feel more confident about yourself.`,
      `46.webp`,
      `***Opportunity to learn about yourself and your preferences`,
      `With speed dating, you put yourself out there in the actual dating world, not like dating apps, where you tag yourself and say that you are looking for a date. It helps you understand yourself and what you want in your partner before you actually start dating.`,
      `47.webp`,
      `***Get to know If you click`,
      `In the dating app world, people have many choices, so they don’t put much effort into knowing the other person or who they click with, but with speed dating, you get to meet the person and can get an idea if you have something in common with the other person within a few minutes.`,
      `So everyone should give it a try. It's not only an amazing way to meet someone special but it's also good to find some buddies along the way.`,

      `***Bungee jumping or rock climbing`,

It's not about height, eye color, or how you dress, but more importantly, what qualities they are looking for because everyone has something non-negotiable for them.`,
      `55.webp`,
      `***Make eye contact and be a listener`,

      `57.webp`,
      `***Be interested in what they are passionate about`,

      `In the end, it depends on your feelings as well, whether they are true or just infatuation. First, you can be clear about how you feel about the other person and then what they like or are looking for, and if they are interested in you, then the love will come naturally.`,
